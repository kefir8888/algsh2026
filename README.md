# Algorithms SHAD Helper (Winter 2025 - Spring 2026)

Repository for the course on algorithms and data structures.

Authors: Ilya Osokin, Prokhor Iashin.

## Materials

The repository is updated according to the course flow. Here you can find the following parts of the course:

- [Home Assignments](/home_assignments)
- [Lectures](/lectures/)

There are additional resources:

- [Google Classroom](https://classroom.google.com/c/ODM1MDQ3MTEwMTU0?cjc=bsg5r6lz) - home assignments; the deadline is 23:59 Moscow time (GMT+3) the day before the lecture (Wednesday)
- [Overleaf Project](https://www.overleaf.com/read/kchxqjgxxmcf#98cada) - LaTeX sources of home assignment

## Recommended Literature

You may also see the list of recommended literature:

- [Introduction to Algorithms. Cormen. (RU)](https://disk.yandex.ru/i/CLzI0vEW4W3gXQ) - the book covers all the topics discussed in the course and much more. You may use it as a handbook or an instrument of self-defence.
- [Algorithms. Dasgupta. (RU)](https://disk.yandex.ru/i/ur9vX1VuXMKeWg) - simpler and shorter book.
